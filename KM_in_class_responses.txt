In class exercise

If you wanted to reuse this program for a file that had 17 headers lines. What line of code would you change in our program?

 Write the line of code that you will replace here: if LineNumber > 0:

 What will be the new code?

 Write the new code here: if LineNumber > 16:

Would happen if we don’t included import sys in our program?

 Write you answer here: If we do not import sys, we cannot use the sys.argv function to call on argument variables in the command line.

Let’s suppose that the third file that the user provides as input has only one column. What error message will be generated?

 Write you answer here: "Line 1 not XY format in file 3"

Our program split lines of input files (except the first file) into elements that are tab delimitated. However, data could be split by , or many other characters. In this case is a good idea to define a new variable that takes the delimiter provide by the user. Using what you learn about sys.argv in this class`. Write a variable that reads a delimiter (e.g ',') provided as the first input file.

 Write your code here: delimiter= sys.argv[1]
 on line 34: MasterList[RecordNum] += ('delimiter' + ElementList[1])
 on line 16: FileList= sys.argv[2:]
